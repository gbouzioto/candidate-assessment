## Twitter Word Cloud API

### Description
Create an authenticated REST API endpoint, using your preferred Python framework, which will return a word cloud for the last 24h of any hashtag you choose from Twitter. You may choose any technology you want for storing the data.

### Requirements
The endpoint should be able to accept only authenticated requests (key, session, etc.) containing the following fields:
- The maximum number of words to return
- Whether the response should be JSON or CSV formatted

The response should contain the following fields in the format requested:
- The information related to the number of words requested
- The topic
- The timestamp of the first tweet
- The timestamp of the last tweet

Also, please try to include any relevant unit test and code comments with your work.

### Delivery
Delivery instruction can be found [here](README.md).

Please do a pull request and we will send you our questions via the comments functionality of github!

It would be good if the code is accompanied by a 1-page report of the work you have done.
Please, do not spend more than an afternoon on this task. It is just a basis to allow a technical interview and a pleasant tech discussion!
